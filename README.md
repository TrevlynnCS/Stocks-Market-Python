# Stocks Market Python

This repository is a Python3 script which I have run in the linux terminal. It retrieves a stock market website with real stock prices( the web page will be downloaded within tophat).

The aim of the script is to recommend either to buy or sell the requested stock. If the current price is below the average value for the 52 week high and low then you will sell the stock, otherwise you will be recommended to buy the stock.

*Please note this IS NOT a real-life calculation to buy/sell your stocks in reality.
